# This is the Proof Of Concept code for CVE-2021-29155.

The range tracking on pointer arithmetic on the speculative domain was insufficient. 

It was possible to extract kernel data via a sidechannel. 

This is a proof of concept you can read up to 0x5fff bytes out of bounds from the last element of our map onwards.

This issue was fixxed in 5.12 and pachported to serveral LTS kernels.

However if you are still interesed how this works and see a spectre exploit in action you can run the program as sudo. Then the spectre mitigations do not kick in.

Usage:
```
sudo ./bpf_exploit 0 3 0x0 0x5ff0
```

Where 0 3 correspond to 2 different threads, which run on a different physical core for the exploit to work.
